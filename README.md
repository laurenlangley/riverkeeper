## Summary

This water-quality interactive data visualization project is a customized system that was created to offer a comprehensive data management and visualization solution for Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, an nonprofit environmental advocacy organization located in Georgia. It was completed in partial fulfillment of a Master’s of Science in Digital Media from Georgia Institute of Technology.

The project is a publicly accessible web-based interactive data visualization tool that displays water-quality data collected and analyzed by Chattahoochee Riverkeeper’s Neighborhood Water Watch (NWW) program. The tool allows users to select any of the Neighborhood Water Watch water sample sites from a map and list view and display the corresponding data in a graphical view. The user can then interact with the data, representing E. coli, turbidity, rainfall levels, and specific conductiviy by manipulating a timeline slider. The results of a user’s interactions displays a unique visualization that is useful to them for professional or educational purposes.
