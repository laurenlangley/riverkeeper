## Summary

This water-quality interactive data visualization project is a customized system that was created to offer a comprehensive data management and visualization solution for Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, an nonprofit environmental advocacy organization located in Georgia. It was completed in partial fulfillment of a Master’s of Science in Digital Media from Georgia Institute of Technology.

The project is a publicly accessible web-based interactive data visualization tool that displays water-quality data collected and analyzed by Chattahoochee Riverkeeper’s Neighborhood Water Watch (NWW) program. The tool allows users to select any of the Neighborhood Water Watch water sample sites from a map and list view and display the corresponding data in a graphical view. The user can then interact with the data, representing E. coli, turbidity, rainfall levels, and specific conductiviy by manipulating a timeline slider. The results of a user’s interactions displays a unique visualization that is useful to them for professional or educational purposes.

Chattahoochee Riverkeeper recognized the benefits the NWW program could reap with this tool and wanted to continue our relationship for me to fully implement it into their workflow. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded Chattahoochee Riverkeeper (CRK) a $50,000 Urban Waters grant to support (in part) the production of this tool. The tool was officially rolled out in June 2013 and can be seen [here](http://www.chattahoochee.org/nww/)

Another goal of this project was to contribute my work to the open source community so that other nonprofit environmental agencies may customize this tool to suit their needs. And so, here we are...enjoy the code and please keep in touch about how you are utilizing it in your projects!
